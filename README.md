# MLsub

An implementation in OCaml of _ML with subtyping_ (aka
[MLsub](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3009837.3009882)). This is mostly a
translation of the one found in [The Simple Essence of Algebraic
Subtyping](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3409006) by Lionel Parreaux (which
originates from [this blog
post](https://lptk.github.io/programming/2020/03/26/demystifying-mlsub.html) and
was [implemented in Scala](https://github.com/LPTK/simple-sub)) that I performed
in order to understand it better.
